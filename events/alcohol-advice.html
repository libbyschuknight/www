  <h1>New Zealand Alcohol Policies</h1>
  <h2>Advice for Events</h2>

  <p>
    In New Zealand, the supply of alcohol is governed by the
    <a href="http://www.alcohol.org.nz/management-laws/nz-alcohol-laws/sale-and-supply-of-alcohol-act-2012">Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012</a>,
    which delegates certain responsibilities to District Licensing Committees (DLCs).
    These committees publish guidelines regarding the supply of alcohol at events, such as this
    <a href="https://ccc.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Special-Licence-Application-Flowchart-CON8934-FINAL.pdf">Christchurch City Council flowchart</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Ticketed Events such as Rails Camp have three options under these regulations if they wish to have alcohol:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Apply for a Special License for the event from the <abbr title="District Licensing Committee">DLC</abbr></li>
    <li>Purchase the alcohol from the event caterers, who must have a caterer‚Äôs license</li>
    <li>Check with the <abbr title="District Licensing Committee">DLC</abbr> whether BYO would be permitted at the event (it may not be!)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Ruby New Zealand committee can assist event organisers to select the best option and apply for the appropriate licenses.</p>

  <h3>Host Responsibility</h3>

  <p>
    As an event organiser, regardless of whether your event requires a special licence, you still have a responsibility to provide a safe drinking environment. This means having management plans that include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Setting drinking expectations in advance with those attending</li>
    <li>Keeping an eye on alcohol intake of guests</li>
    <li>Providing food and water</li>
    <li>Focusing activity on the social aspect of the occasion</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you have any questions about alcohol at Ruby New Zealand events,
    please get in touch with the <a href="mailto:committee@ruby.nz">committee</a>. Thanks! üçª
